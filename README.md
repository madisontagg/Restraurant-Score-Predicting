Business Problem: Terry Smits runs the REstaurant Inspection team at the San Francisco Department of Public Health. His Team is facing a larger
backlog of restaurants that need to be inspected as a result of the COVID-19 crisis. He wants to use historical data to prioritize which restaurants
to inspect over the next few weeks, with the goal of prioritizing the restaurants most likely to receive poor scores.

Data Task: Predict restaurant health inspection scores in San Francisco bases on a set of provided features.
